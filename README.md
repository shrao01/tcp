This is the mini project of data communication course as a part of engineering degree.

Question:For your exercises, you will be creating the following simple topology, where you have
a source node, a destination node, and an intermediate router (marked "S", "D", and "R"
respectively).

The part between node "S" and node "R" is marked as link-1, and the part between node
"R" and node "D" is marked as link-2. Link-1 is supposed to be the wired part of the
network, with high bandwidth, and (almost) no errors. Link-2 is supposed to be the
wireless hop of the network, with lower bandwidth, and high error probability (although
you will introduce wireless errors only in a later part of the assignment).with the
following parameters:
o Link-1: 100Mbps, 50ms latency
o Link-2: 100Kbps, 1ms latency
